this is a preliminary BOM from the eurorack version:

double check things as some parts have been changed or added for the 4U version!
Electrolytic capacitors have been swapped for THT types and that you don't need sliders as they have all been swapped for pots.... 

I will make my own BOM soon as I can but double check things against the dip files and you should be ok!
